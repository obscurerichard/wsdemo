# wsdemo

A Websocket competition.  Will your favorite platform come out on top?
If you think your platform of choice was poorly represented, "submit a
pull requestâ„¢"

## How do you include a contestant?

Just create the "Hello, World!" of socket servers, an echo server that
speaks WebSocket version 13 (13 is the only version my client supports).

First write your implementation in place it in the `competition/`
directory.

Added any instructions needed to install dependencies in
`configure_ubuntu-12.04.sh`.  Add any build instructions to
`competition/Makefile` if your project needs to be compiled

wsdemo_bench utilizes [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) to start
and stop the servers while running the tests.  In order to include
your server in the test you need to create a supervisord ini file in
`competition/servers`.  

    [program:%(server_name)s]
    command=%(command)s
    autostart=false
    autorestart=false
    startretries=0
    stopasgroup=true
    killasgroup=true
    
The server name must follow the following format:

    {language}-{platform}

For instance if you wrote an echo server using `bash` and `nc` the
server name would be `bash-nc`.  You can add additional demarcations
if needed.  For instance the Python tornado example has a single
threaded version and a multiprocessor version which go by the name
`python-tornado-1` and `python-tornado-N`.

Next, you need to add your server to the server list in
`wsdemo_bench.app.src` configuration file.

Finally, add yourself to the AUTHORS file; you've earned it.

## Running the benchmark

It is best to run the benchmark client on a separate machine than the
servers.  

Using two brand new Ubuntu 12.04 servers, run the
`configure_ubuntu-12.04.sh` script on each. This script will destructively
alter each server so use caution and review the script before running
it.

If you want to use a different OS, use `configure_ubuntu-12.04.sh` as a
template for configuring your system of choice.

Next compile the code on both machines:

      make

To run a single benchmark on a server do the following:

    ./runtest db_path hostname port client_count duration

For instance for a benchmark of 192.168.1.5:8000 of 1000 clients lasting 60
seconds with with the data stored at `data/myserver` the command would
be:

    ./runtest data/myserver 192.168.1.5 8000 1000 60


## Running the entire suite on your own servers

There are two components in wsdemo_bench. The first component is
`supervisord`

wsdemo_bench communicates with Supervisord to start and stop each
server before each benchmark.

On the machine that you are running the servers on do the following:

    sudo bash
    ulimit -n 999999
    cd competition
    supervisord

You can monitor supervisord by using the `supervisorctl` command:

    competition/ $ supervisorctl status


Next, on the client machine create a `config/small-scale.config` file:

    [
        {sasl, [
            {sasl_error_logger, {file, LogFile}}]},

        {wsdemo_bench, [
                    {host, Ip},
                    {port, 8000},
                    {db_root, DbRoot},
                    {clients, 100},
                    {seconds, 10},
                    {supervisord, {ServerHost, 9001}}]}].


Replace `LogFile`, `Ip`, `DbRoot` and `ServerHost` with the correct
values.  Ensure that both the path to `LogFile` and the path to
`DbRoot` exist or the test will crash.
   
This configuration file describe a test using 100 clients for
10 seconds each test. We will use this smaller test to ensure that all
the servers start and stop properly.

To run this benchmark, do the following:

    sudo bash
    ulimit -n 999999
    ./bin/run_all_tests.sh -config config/small-scale.config

If all goes well, you should see the suite running in front of your
eyes.  Let that run for the entire test.  It should run for 12 minutes
or so.

If any of the servers crashes you can do the following to diagnose the cause:

    competition/ $ supervisorctl tail $SERVER_NAME stderr

After the small scale test, it is time to run the full scale test:

    [
        {sasl, [
            {sasl_error_logger, {file, LogFile}}]},

        {wsdemo_bench, [
                    {host, Ip},
                    {port, 8000},
                    {db_root, DbRoot},
                    {supervisord, {ServerHost, 9001}}]}].

## Suite config

Here is the full spec for the wsdemo_bench config:

     [
        {host, Host :: string()},
        {port, Port :: integer()},
        {db_root, DbRoot :: directory()},
        {supervisord, {Host, 9001}},
        {clients, number()}, % defaults to 10000
        {seconds, number()}, % defaults to 600
        {servers, [ServerName1::string(), ..., ServerNameN::string()]} % defaults to full suite
     ]        


## Exporting the data

The resulting `leveldb` databases will be placed in your configured
`db_root`.  The events are stored as binary Erlang terms in the
database so you will need to export the events to use them.

There are two scripts to do that. `./bin/compile_all_stats.sh` and
`./bin/convert_all_stats.sh`

`./bin/compile_all_stats.sh` creates three `.csv` tables:

   * counts.csv - the sums of all the events
   * handshake_times.csv - timestamp, elapsed usecs for each handshake
   * message_latencies.csv - timestamp, elapsed usecs for each message

`./bin/convert_all_stats.sh` dumps the raw events as a `events.csv` table.

The events data has the following fields:

    timestamp, type, client_id, event_key, event_data

   * timestamp - The timestamp of the event
   * type - the server type
   * client_id - A string that identifies the client
   * event_key - The event type
   * event_data - event specific data

The `event_data` is used to pair `ws_init` and `ws_onopen` events to
calculate the elapsed handshake time and the `event_data` is used to
pair `send_message` events to `recv_message` events to calculate the
elapsed message time.  The `event_data` for `'EXIT'` events take the
format of `{pid(), Reason :: any()}`. These are some of the expected
reasons for a client crash:

    connection_timeout - The client could not establish a connection
                         with the server in under 2 seconds
    normal - The server closed the connection.  This should never
             happen for this benchmark

Any reason other than these are an unexpected error and should be
[reported](https://github.com/ericmoritz/wsdemo/issues) as an issue.
If you see a `{error, Reason}` you should probably file a bug report
as well unless you can determine it is a server issue.
